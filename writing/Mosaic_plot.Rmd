## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
altfuel_larger <- left_join(altfuel, combine_fueltype, by = "facility_type") 


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

mosaic_fueltype <- ggplot(data = altfuel_larger) +
  geom_mosaic(aes(x = product(fuel_type_code, facil_group), fill = fuel_type_code, color = fuel_type_code)) +  
  scale_color_gradientn(colors = wes_palette("Zissou1", type = "discrete")) +
  labs(y="Fuel Types Used", x="Facility Type", title = "Mosaic Plot of Fuel Type Usage by Facility Type") +
  scale_y_discrete(guide=guide_axis(n.dodge=3))
 

mosaic_fueltype + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 7, angle = 90)) + theme(
  axis.text.y = element_text(size = 6, angle = 45, hjust = 1)
  )
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
